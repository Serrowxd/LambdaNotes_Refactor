# LambdaNotes_Refactor

A new and improved Lambda Notes done post-graduation from Lambda.

# ToDo

- **Landing**

  - Possibly adjust sign-up and sign-in buttons to transition down when loading the login-signup screens.

- **Features**:

  - A calendar to keep track of note dates.
  - Maybe a daily to-do popover
  - _think dayplanner but mobile/desktop_

- **Noteview**:
  - It wouldn't hurt to have maybe some buttons added to the small-version of the navigation in the noteview section. Possibly icons that reference different thing.
  - Second idea, just collapse the blue bar and fill the screen with the notes.
